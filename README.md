# Downtime-Analyzer

### 1.	Purpose and Audience

This cookbook is designed for Solution Architects, AI Engineers, and technical leaders looking to implement sophisticated generative AI solutions to solve real-world business problems, moving beyond toy examples to create impactful applications. It focuses on a multi-agent AI system designed to reduce production downtime in a manufacturing environment—a scenario where every minute of inefficiency translates to significant financial losses and material waste.
The core of the solution discussed is a conversational AI solution that empowers operators and managers to troubleshoot and resolve downtime issues using natural language. This platform leverages a multi-agent architecture, where specialized AI agents interact not only with Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4o via the Assistants API but also with other critical enterprise systems and AI algorithms. These include historical data logs, real-time sensor data, and optimization engines such as CPLEX.

**Why this matters:** Traditional factory dashboards and reports can overwhelm users with data but still require manual analysis which takes time. By asking a natural language question, a plant manager or engineer can get immediate answers — whether it’s querying last week’s stoppages, finding how to fix a machine, or simulating improvements. This system integrates with the company’s data sources and workflows (e.g. pulling data from SQL databases, retrieving information from equipment manuals, interfacing with maintenance ticket systems) to ensure answers are relevant and actionable in the real operational environment. The emphasis is on creating robust, scalable, and reliable solutions that deliver measurable business value, as exemplified by the described system which achieved over $10 million in annual savings for a major food manufacturer.
The audience will gain insights into:
*	Designing and implementing multi-agent AI systems (RAG, Code Generation, Report Generation)
*	Integrating LLMs with diverse data sources and external tools like SQL databases and optimization solvers.
*	Addressing challenges such as noisy data, user context management, and ensuring operational safety compliance.
*	Evaluating the performance and impact of such AI solutions.
*	Optimizing costs and preparing for production deployment.
  
**Audience:** This document is for technical leads and architects who will design and implement such an AI assistant. It assumes familiarity with concepts like LLM APIs, vector databases, and integration of APIs/DBs, but it explains the design choices and pitfalls with the help of use cases. By the end, a reader should understand how to build a multi-agent LLM application that works within an enterprise architecture — including how it routes user questions to different specialized agents, how those agents work under the hood, and how to evaluate and deploy the system for production use. 

#### 2. Use Cases Overview
In our downtime reduction assistant, we have multiple specialized LLM-powered agents, each designed to handle a category of user queries. An Orchestrator Service acts as a traffic controller: it analyzes each user question (through intent classification or rules) and routes it to the appropriate agent. The core use cases and corresponding agents include:

*	Data Querying (SQL Agent) – Handles analytical questions like “What were the top 10 stoppages last week?” by querying databases and summarizing results.
*	Troubleshooting Q&A (RAG Agent) – Handles maintenance and how-to questions like “How do I fix a jam on Conveyor 3?” by retrieving relevant info from manuals (Retrieval-Augmented Generation with citations).
*	Optimization & Simulation (CPLEX Agent) – Handles "what if" and optimization questions like “Simulate the yield change if we move product X to a different line” by formulating and solving an optimization or performing a simulation, possibly using an optimization engine (e.g. CPLEX).
  
Each agent uses the LLM in a different way (from writing SQL, to fetching documents, to generating code), but they all integrate with existing factory systems. The diagram below shows the high-level architecture and data flow of the solution, with the orchestrator, agents, data layers, and response formatter working together for each query.

*The Orchestrator Service receives user questions (Step 2) from the web UI and routes them (Step 4) to the appropriate agent based on intent. 
The agent (SQL, RAG, CPLEX, etc.) may fetch data from relevant sources (Step 5: e.g., SQL DB, vector store, sensors) and returns an intermediate result (Step 6). 
The Response Layer (Final Answer, Guardrails, Recommendation services) parses and formats this result (Step 7) into a user-friendly answer (Step 8), potentially with follow-up suggestions. The full answer is sent back to the user (Steps 10–11). The system also stores conversation context in a memory store (Steps 3 and 9) so that follow-up questions can be understood in context.*

Below, we go through each use case in detail, including how the agent works (tech stack), an example conversation flow, implementation snippets, and key lessons learned.
